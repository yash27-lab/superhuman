# IMO Bench

See https://imobench.github.io for more info.

## Usage

*   IMO-AnswerBench: [answerbench_v2.csv](answerbench_v2.csv)
*   IMO-ProofBench: [proofbench.csv](proofbench.csv)
*   IMO-GradingBench: [gradingbench.csv](gradingbench.csv)

As of 02/12/2026, we updated IMO-Answerbench with `answerbench_v2.csv` to fix
some problems that had ambiguous problem statements or incorrect answers.
The previous version [answerbench.csv](answerbench.csv) is now deprecated.

## Dataset Validation

To validate the integrity and schema of the IMO Bench CSV files, run:

```bash
python3 imobench/validate_imobench.py
...
