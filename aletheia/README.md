# Aletheia

This directory contains prompts and responses from Aletheia on research level
math problems.

Note that 2 outputs, one in
Erdos problems and one in LeeSeo26, are not from Aletheia. The latter is for
illustration purposes only (a correct solution was obtained by various models,
including Aletheia).

* A generalization of Erdos-1051, proving irrationality of certain rapidly converging series: [tex](BKKKZ26/BKKKZ26.tex), [pdf](BKKKZ26/BKKKZ26.pdf) ([full paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21442)).
* Results from a semi-autonomous case study on applying Gemini to open Erdős problems: [tex](Erdos/Erdos.tex), [pdf](Erdos/Erdos.pdf) ([full paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22401)).
* Computations of eigenweights for the Arithmetic Hirzebruch Proportionality Principle of Feng--Yun--Zhang: [tex](F26/F26.tex), [pdf](F26/F26.pdf) ([full paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23245)).
* An initial case of a non-trivial eigenweight computation: [tex](FYZ26/FYZ26.tex), [pdf](FYZ26/FYZ26.pdf) ([full paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18557)).
* A mathematical input to the paper "Strongly polynomial iterations for robust Markov chains" by Asadi–Chatterjee–Goharshady–
Karrabi–Montaseri–Pagano. It establishes that specific bounded combinations of numbers are in polynomially many dyadic intervals: [tex](ACGKMP/ACGKMP.tex), [pdf](ACGKMP/ACGKMP.pdf) ([full paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23229)).
