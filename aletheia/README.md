# Aletheia

This directory contains prompts and responses from Aletheia on research level
math problems.

Note that 2 outputs, one in
Erdos problems and one in LeeSeo26, are not from Aletheia. The latter is for
illustration purposes only (a correct solution was obtained by various models,
including Aletheia).

* A generalization of Erdos-1051, proving irrationality of certain rapidly converging series: [tex](BKKKZ26/BKKKZ26.tex), [pdf](BKKKZ26/BKKKZ26.pdf) ([full paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21442)).
* Results from a semi-autonomous case study on applying Gemini to open Erdős problems: [tex](Erdos/Erdos.tex), [pdf](Erdos/Erdos.pdf) ([full paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22401)).
